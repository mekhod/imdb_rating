# IMDB practice project

## Project Overview
In this practice project a labeled IMDB review dataset (positive or negative) is used to train a deep nueral network binary classifier.

## Steps:
* The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using the Tokenizer method available in keras.preprocessing.text.
* A deep neural network architecture consisting of two fully connected dense layers and a sigmoid layer is built.
* The model is trained and the best model weights are stored.
* The model with the best model weights are constructed and is evaluated using the test dataset.

## Results:
* An accuracy of over 86% is achieved.
